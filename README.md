# David Spray - Portfolio Website

Hello! You've reached my portfolio website's source code.
This web app consists of a 3d rendering engine written from scratch following along with the [UC Davis intro to computer graphics lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01YSK5gIEYQ&list=PL_w_qWAQZtAZhtzPI5pkAtcUVgmzdAP8g&index=1&t=3s), and a playable canyon runner game, all rendered to a web Canvas.

As a fun aside, the canyon runner terrain is completely procedurally generated!

The live version of the website can be found [here](https://david-spray.scot/).

## Game Controls

You can currently strafe your star-fighter left and right with the **w** and **d** keys, and you can fire your star-fighter's lazer with the **space** key.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
